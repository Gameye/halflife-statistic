Feature: As an API user I want to know the game scores per player

    Scenario Outline:
        Given I play a game of tf2
        And I store logs in <logfile>
        When I process the logs
        Then player <player> had <kills> kills
        And player <player> had <assists> assists
        And player <player> had <deaths> deaths

    Examples:
